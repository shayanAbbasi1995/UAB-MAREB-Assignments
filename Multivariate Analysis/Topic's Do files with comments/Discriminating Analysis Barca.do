*for prediction purposes, knn works much better
*xi: discrim knn p03_1 - p03_16 p04 i.p05 p06, k(20) group(p02)
tabulate p02

*We want to make sure that 
*xi shows that it's a qualitative variable
xi: discrim lda p03_1 - p03_16 p04 i.p05 p06, group(p02)

*we know that our explatory variables have colinearity (multicoliniearity problem)
*we can do factor analysis and use factors to do discriminative analysis
factor p03_1-p03_16, pcf 
predict international_d identity reference weakness business

xi: discrim lda international_d identity reference weakness business p04 i.p05 p06, group(p02)

*When we have imbalance between categories of the dependent variable, we can change the priors (here the imbalance is not serious):
xi: discrim lda international_d identity reference weakness business p04 i.p05 p06, group(p02) priors(0.5, 0.5)

*We can make a discrimination function in quadratic form using the 'qda', knowing that it will increase the fitting.
xi: discrim qda international_d identity reference weakness business p04 i.p05 p06, group(p02) priors(0.5, 0.5)
